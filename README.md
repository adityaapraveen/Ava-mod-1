# Functions and Errors

The provided Solidity project is a simple "bank" contract with three functions. It allows deposits with a minimum amount requirement, performs secure addition with assertion checks, and demonstrates explicit transaction reversal with custom error messages.

## Description

Deposit Function: Users can deposit funds, but the deposit amount must be greater than 100 Wei, enforced using the require statement.

Addition Function: This function calculates the sum of two numbers and uses an assert statement to ensure the result falls within a specific range, offering an example of internal consistency checks.

Reverting Function: The third function demonstrates the use of the revert statement to instantly revert transactions with a custom error message, showcasing transaction control within a smart contract.

This project provides a simple illustration of transaction processing, validation, and error handling in Ethereum smart contracts.
